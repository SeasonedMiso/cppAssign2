WRITE README

ensure that your tarball works and is not corrupt

// provide a README file explaining what each file submitted does and
// how it fits into the program as a whole.The README file should not explain any
// theory that you have used.The README be used by the tutors if they encounter
// any problems

//explain truncating user in if weird in like -t 4 2 40 40
//main takes user input, creates instance of frameSequence, which is resposible for processing

Works as explainaed in assignment briefing

./out/extractor ./resources/Examples/larger_image.pgm -t 4 2 40 40 -s 500 500 -w none abcde -w reverse revTest

outputs to ./out/

For some reason is seen as a document and not as an image in vscode and the mac finder, but still opens

-t 0 0 0 100 -s 100 100 -w none VERTICAL
-t 0 0 100 0 -s 100 100 -w none HORIZONTAL

deal with backwards in only one axis?
-t 10 10 0 20 -s 100 100 -w none halfback
-t 10 10 0 20 -s 100 100 -w none halfback
