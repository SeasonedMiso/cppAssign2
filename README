Works as explainaed in assignment briefing

./out/extractor ./resources/Examples/larger_image.pgm -t 4 2 40 40 -s 500 500 -w none abcde -w reverse revTest

outputs to ./out/

For some reason is seen as a document and not as an image in vscode and the mac finder, but still opens

if the input given has a different length for distance traveled from x1 to x2, when compared to y1 and y2, it will go with the shortest value

making an exception for if x1 and x2, or y1 and y2 are the same, in which case it will do a vertical or horizontal pan

## To implement

<!-- reverse is breaking stuff -->

vertical is broken

backwards horizontal and vertical cases

deal with backwards in only one axis?
-t 10 10 0 20 -s 100 100 -w none halfback
-t 10 10 0 20 -s 100 100 -w none halfback

vertical:

x normal: returns basic case (x incremented)
./out/extractor ./resources/Examples/larger_image.pgm -t 0 10 0 0 -s 100 100 -w none cutoff

    x backwards
    ./out/extractor ./resources/Examples/larger_image.pgm -t 0 10 0 0 -s 100 100 -w none cutoff
