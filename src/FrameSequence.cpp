// PGM images are greyscale — meaning they have no colour, and use only one value to
// encode an intensity that ranges from (black = 0) through to (white=255). Each value is
// thus stored as an ‘unsigned char’. The images we will provide are ‘raw’ PGM i.e. binary
// files. However, they have a text header, so you usually open the file as binary (ios::binary),
// but use the >> and << operators to read/write the header information. Getline() is very
// useful for reading and discarding comment lines. The header is followed by a block of
// bytes, which represent the image intensities. You can use the read() and write() methods
// to manipulate this data. Look at the function prototypes to see what arguments they
// expect (www.cplusplus.com can help here if you have no C++ reference). The PGM
// images you will receive will have the format:
// P5

// #comment line(there can be more than 1 of these comment lines)
// #the string P5 will always be the first item in the file.
// width height
// 255
// binary_data_block

// where width and height are integers representing the number of columns and rows making
// up the image matrix. There is a newline after each line — use “ws” to process this correctly.
// After reading 255 (and using the ws manipulator) you will be at the start of the binary
// data (width*height unsigned chars) which you can read in using read(). If you write out
// a PGM image you needn’t include any comments, although it
// is good practice to indicate what application generated the image. You can open the
// output image as a binary file, write out the text header using the usual text operator <<
// and then use write() to output the binary data (in one statment!) before closing the file.
// Have a look at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm for more information on the
// image format (and it’s history).

// Remember that image data(being a 2D array of unsigned char) is indexed from[0][0] and that this is the top left hand corner of the image.Generally we process image data
//                                                                                       line by line,
//     starting from the top.This is in fact how the binary image data is stored
//         in the PGM format — so you can read
//         / write the entire image with one read() / write() statement !This is very convenient.We will provide some PGM images.You can view the effects of your image operations using an image viewer like Gimp on Ubuntu.

// You always move in 1 pixels steps through the input image (unless your tackle the
// mastery work section and use an acceleration function). The frame origin is the top
// left corner of the frame. Remember that images are indexed with (0,0) being the
// top left screen corner, x increasing left to right and y increasing down the screen —
// exactly like a matrix/array (which is why we use them for images of course).

// ensure code like FrameSequence myVideoFrames;
// is valid and will compile

// — create an instance of the class on the stack.To set class
//     variables,
//     use setter methods e.g.myVideoFrames.setFrameSize(width, height);
// and so on
